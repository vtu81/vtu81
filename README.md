### Hi there 👋

![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=vtu81)

<!-- ⚠️ My personal website is currently not available! -->

Hello, I am **Tinghao Xie 谢廷浩**, a first year ECE PhD student at Princeton. I just received my Bachelor degree from [Computer Science and Technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn) at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).
<!-- Earlier, I just finished my one-term visit at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). -->

My research interest mainly lies in adversarial machine learning. Specifically, I am thrilled to work on ML robustness, interpretability and fairness. On the other hand, I am also actively exploring the intersection of ML and other fields (system, network, etc.).


<!-- I found the **robustness of machine learning** being both a “dark cloud” and an attractive perspective to work on. Specifically, my research interest could be described in two aspects: First, I intend to study and solve security concerns involving current non-robust deep learning models; Second, I would like to better understand AI’s behaviors and make their predictions more human-like through explainable and causal methods. In summary, I hope to fully explore the breadth and depth of **secure, robust, and reliable AI**. Yet, I'm always on my way looking for things that intrigue me, and tend to hold an open mind for whatever is coming. I (wish to) have fun doing research. -->

Earlier, I finished our project **Subnet Replacement Attack (SRA)**[[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12965)[[code]](https://github.com/Unispac/Subnet-Replacement-Attack) (accepted by CVPR'22) of the first gray-box and physically realizable backdoor weight attack, collaborating with [Xiangyu Qi](https://unispac.github.io) at Princeton University, advised by Principal Researcher Jifeng Zhu at Tencent Zhuque Lab and [Prof. Kai Bu](https://list.zju.edu.cn/kaibu/) at ZJU. I was also fortunate to work with [Prof. Ting Wang](https://alps-lab.github.io/about/) on **backdoor certification**[[blog]](https://tinghaoxie.comt/posts/2021/12/Backdoor-Certification/) and **backdoor restoration**[[blog]](https://tinghaoxie.com/posts/2021/12/Backdoor-Trigger-Restoration/) at Pennsylvania State University as an intern, meanwhile co-advised by [Prof. Shouling Ji](https://nesa.zju.edu.cn/webpage/crew/jsl.html) at ZJU [NESA Lab](https://nesa.zju.edu.cn/index.html). Even before, I worked with [Prof. Jianhai Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/cjhe), designed and implemented **Enchecap**[[code]](https://github.com/vtu81/Enchecap), an encrypted (enclave-based) heterogeneous calculation protocol.
