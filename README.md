### Hi there 👋

![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=vtu81)

Hello, I am **Tinghao(Vitus) Xie 谢廷浩**, a senior undergraduate student majoring in [Computer Science and Technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn) at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), and now visiting the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk).

My current research interest lies in the intersection of secure, efficient, robust AI and systems. The project I am now working on involves neural network verification, backdoor attacks and defenses. I am also interested in adversarial learning, neural network explanation, etc. Things at system-level usually impress me, e.g. scalable and efficient AI, system security. Yet, I’m always on my way looking for things that intrigue me, and tend to hold an open mind for whatever is coming. I (wish to) do research for fun.

I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Ting Wang](https://www.alpslab.ai) at PSU as an intern, meanwhile co-advised by [Prof. Shouling Ji](https://nesa.zju.edu.cn/webpage/crew/jsl.html) at ZJU [NESA Lab](https://nesa.zju.edu.cn/index.html). Recently, I am also working on [Subnet Replacement Backdoor Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07240), collaborating with [Xiangyu Qi](https://unispac.github.io) at Princeton University and advised by Principal Researcher Jifeng Zhu at Tencent Zhuque Lab. Before that, I worked with [Prof. Jianghai Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/cjhe) and finished [Enchecap](https://tinghaoxie.com/posts/2020/03/Enchecap/), an encrypted (enclave-based) heterogeneous calculation protocol.
