### Hi there 👋

![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=vtu81)

Hello, I am **Tinghao(Vitus) Xie 谢廷浩**, a senior undergraduate student majoring in [Computer Science and Technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn) at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), and now visiting the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/).

My current research interest lies around secure, robust and reliable AI. The projects I am now working on and have finished involve neural network verification, certified and adversarial robustness, backdoor attacks and defenses. Building AI that makes human-like decisions attracts me, where robustness and security may be good perspectives to dive in. I have enthusiasm in explanable AI, out-of distribution generalization, and potential ways to improve current models fundamentally. Yet, I'm always on my way looking for things that intrigue me, and tend to hold an open mind for whatever is coming. I (wish to) have fun doing research.

I am fortunate to be working with [Prof. Ting Wang](https://www.alpslab.ai) on **backdoor certification** at Pennsylvania State University as an intern, meanwhile co-advised by [Prof. Shouling Ji](https://nesa.zju.edu.cn/webpage/crew/jsl.html) at ZJU [NESA Lab](https://nesa.zju.edu.cn/index.html). I just finished the project **Subnet Replacement Attack (SRA)**[[paper]](https://tinghaoxie.com/files/Subnet_Replacement_Attack.pdf)[[code]](https://github.com/Unispac/Subnet-Replacement-Attack) where we proposed the first gray-box and physically realizable backdoor weight attack, collaborating with [Xiangyu Qi](https://unispac.github.io) at Princeton University and advised by Principal Researcher Jifeng Zhu at Tencent Zhuque Lab. Before that, I worked with [Prof. Jianghai Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/cjhe), designed and implemented **Enchecap**[[code]](https://github.com/vtu81/Enchecap), an encrypted (enclave-based) heterogeneous calculation protocol.
